   git clone https://github.com/Ziixh/whatsapp-ai-assistant.git
   cd whatsapp-ai-assistant

2. Install the required dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Download the Vosk model:
   Download the small English model from Vosk Models(https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models?spm=5aebb161.65358e84.0.0.7cf451714kEH30).
   Extract it into the project folder and update the model_path variable in whatsapp_ai_assistant.py.

## Usage

Run the script:
   python whatsapp_ai_assistant.py

Follow the voice prompts to send a message:
   Speak the message you want to send (e.g., "I am tired today").
   When prompted, speak the recipient's name (e.g., "Ali").
   Confirm the recipient and message when asked.

## Notes
   Ensure WhatsApp Desktop is installed and logged in on your system.
   The script assumes WhatsApp is already open when running.
   If the script doesn't work as expected, ensure your microphone and audio settings are configured correctly.

## Known Issues
   The script may require adjustments for different screen resolutions.
   Timing delays may vary depending on your system's performance. Adjust time.sleep() values in the script if needed.
   Ensure the contact name matches exactly as it appears in your WhatsApp contacts.
